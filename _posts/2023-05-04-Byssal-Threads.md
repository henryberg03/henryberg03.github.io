# *Mytilus byssus* Thread Testing
Did one hour in the morning then had to leave for an exam. I came back around 2:20PM and took over from Eric.

<br> Finished the rest of the lower priority samples. I will be moving onto the extra (lowest priority) samples next week. That should be the last set of samples.


<br> Will be in next week on Thursday.
