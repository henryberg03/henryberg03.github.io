# *Mytilus byssus* Capstone Materials & Methods
Research has been wrapping up on the *Mytilus byssus* thread analysis.
I have just wrote the materials and methods for the physiological side of the paper as of April 11th 2025.  

<br> I heavily used the methods section that Grace Leuchtenberger wrote. I used sections that only pertained to the actual thread tensiometer testing and nothing related to the genomics side of the experiment.

Next step is to write the Results section. Looking forward to writing it however I will need to have Matt or Steven Roberts look it over after I finish. 

Weekly updates on progress in the lab notebook.
