# *Mytilus byssus* Thread Analysis & R Programing
Met with mattgeorgephd (Matt) over teams. Went over the basics of the R programing language. We discovered some errors in the program and continued to workshop solutions. We also went over and used the VLOOKUP function in excel.

<br> We solved the errors in the program for the control section of the script. On my own I will be correcting the treatment script to reflect what we changed in the control section. I will also start on combing through the data for irregularities.   


<br> Next meeting with Matt is TBD and depends on when I finish my independent assignments.
