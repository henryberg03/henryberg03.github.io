# *Mytilus byssus* Capstone paper is getting wrapped up
I have finally finished my paper and am ready for Steven Roberts to read it over on the 2nd of June.

<br> I wanted to take a species analysis approach to the paper to I choose not to include strength data in my results.

Steps forward include finishing my slideshow presentation that I will present on the 6th of June in FISH. Other than the presentation I will make any last minute edits to the paper based on Steven Roberts and Matt Georges review. 

Weekly updates on progress in the lab notebook.
