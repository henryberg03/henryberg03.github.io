# *Mytilus byssus* Thread Analysis & R Programing
Met with mattgeorgephd (Matt) over Zoom. We had a short meeting in which we discussed the direction of this & the RNA project. Went through and downloaded all of the required program packages and some basic programing language  

<br> Meeting went well but was cut short due to zooms paywall. My goal is to learn some of the basics of the program on my own before the next time I meet with Matt.  


<br> Next meeting with Matt is TBD and depends on when I finish my independent assignments. We scheduled to meet 8/19/23
