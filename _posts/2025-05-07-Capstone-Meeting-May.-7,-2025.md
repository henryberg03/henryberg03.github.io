# *Mytilus byssus* Capstone Meeting to Resolve Roadblock
I met with Matt George to resolve the roadblock I mentioned in the last meeting.

<br> I now have access to all data and graphs I need to work on the Results and the Discussion sections

I have finished the Introduction sections and the only edits that need to be made is to add proper in-text citations.

Weekly updates on progress in the lab notebook.
