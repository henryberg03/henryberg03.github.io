# *Mytilus byssus* Thread Analysis & R Programing
Hit a wall in the code. Treatment integral section was only giving me one value. I met with Matt George (mattgeorgephd) to try and resolve the issue.

<br> We fixed everything in the program and it produced the accurate values. I also learned how to build plots inside of R, so that we can identify outliers. We found that the program detected no outliers within our datasets.


<br> Tomorrow I will be going through the QC plot images and flagging any plots that don't look right.
