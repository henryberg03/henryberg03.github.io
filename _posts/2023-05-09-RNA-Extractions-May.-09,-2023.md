# *Gigas* RNA Extractions
Met with Grace and Eric at 2:30PM

<br> Shucked a bag of Oysters from the injected, emersed, and control groups. Shucking was done inside of the cold room, samples were then transported into the -80. We will start RNA extractions on those samples on Thursday at 3PM.

<br> This Thursdays RNA extraction session will take the place of the Byssal Thread tests I usually preform that morning.

<br> Will be in this Thursday.
