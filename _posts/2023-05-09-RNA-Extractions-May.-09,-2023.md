# *Gigas* RNA Extractions
Met with Grace and Eric at 2:30PM

<br> Shucked a bag of Oysters from the injected, emersed, and control groups. Shucking was done inside of the cold room, samples were then transported into the -80. We will start RNA extractions on those samples on Thursday at 3PM.

<br> We ran a nanodrop & qubit test on the RNA samples from last weeks session. Two of the samples failed the nanodrop and will need to be retested in the next session (May, 23). Rest of the three samples had good readings on both nanodrop & qubit tests.

<br> This Thursdays RNA extraction session will take the place of the Byssal Thread tests I usually preform that morning. (This weeks RNA extraction session was rescheduled for May 23rd)

<br> Will not be in this Thursday.
