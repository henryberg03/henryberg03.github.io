# *Mytilus byssus* Capstone Roadblock on Results Section
I was starting to analysis and write the results section of my paper, however I hit a road block when the R code for the whole project disappeared from my interface.

<br> Been trying to recover the code from the GitHub for almost a week and have come up empty handed. I have contacted Matt George to set up a meeting to workshop the recovery of the code. Recovery should be simple and solution most likely is something I overlooked either in the repository or GitHub.

In leu of the results section I will be working on the introduction as I don't require the code for this section. introduction will be worked on and ready for review earlier than scheduled (5/7/2025).

I have only been able to enter the Q-Q plot and a few other graphs into the document. I will also finish analysis on those graphs and figure captions. 

Weekly updates on progress in the lab notebook.
