# *Mytilus byssus* Thread Analysis & R Programing
Worked for about 2 hours on my own fixing some more error codes that popped up in R studio pilot program. I solved all of the setwd() error and uploaded all of the treatment graph to the GitHub. Overall a big step in my understanding of R and the project.

<br> Found an error while looking in the environment section of the program. The "integral_control" section. Currently it only reads out a single observation.


<br> In the coming days I will revisit and try to correct the error stated above.
