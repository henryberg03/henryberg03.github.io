# *Gigas* RNA Extraction
Grace led a training for oyster RNA extractions.

<br> Training included both Grace and Eric. I believe we preformed 7 extractions. Unfortunately I had to leave right after the wash steps, so I have yet to preform the quality checks (Nanodrop & Qubit).


<br> Will be in this week on Thursday.
