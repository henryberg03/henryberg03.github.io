# *Mytilus byssus* Thread Analysis & QC plots
Coming back the day after meeting with Matt George (mattgeorgephd) to sort through QC plots.

<br> I've looked through all of the QC plots and flagged a few as "scrap". I did flag a few I need to revisit. The plots I'm revisiting may or may not be errors, I will be seeing how the plaques came off.


<br> Tomorrow I will be going through the QC plots I flagged to revisit and schedule a meeting with Matt to go over making graphs.
