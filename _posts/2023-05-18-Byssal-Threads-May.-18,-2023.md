# *Mytilus byssus* Thread Testing
Preformed thread tests within my normal calendar hours. Worked on testing the extra low prioity control groups.  

<br> The extra control groups are the last groups to be tested. After they've been completed we will be able to move onto data analysis.  


<br> Will be in next week on Tuesday for RNA extraction.
