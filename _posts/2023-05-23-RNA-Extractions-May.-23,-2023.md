# *Gigas* RNA Extractions
Met with Grace and Eric at 2:30PM

<br> Met in FTR 209. Started the Extraction process on 5 of the Oyster samples.

<br> We ran out of time after step 14 (See protocol).

<br> This extraction has taken the time I usually send on the Byssal Thread project.

<br> Will not be in this Thursday.
